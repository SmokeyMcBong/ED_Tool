Brief..
------------

Elite:Dangerous Android Application with 'sendkey' client/server feature

This was initially started as a little side project as I really wanted all the useful
features from certain tools in one easy to use app.
Since then it has continued to slowly grow and become more fleshed out ( and less buggy :) )

<br />

Current Features..
------------
* 'Android-to-PC Buttonbox' - This is a 24 button, user programmable keystroke sender.   
Up to 6 consecutive keystrokes can be used within a sequence for each of the 24 buttons.   
One button for deploying landing gear, another button to request docking, another for.... well , anything you want :)   
To use this feature, the accompanying Windows application is required... ED_Tool-server : https://github.com/SmokeyMcBong/ED_Tool-server 
 

* 'Rare Trading Route planner' - This is direct portal to up to 3 different selectable Rare trade route planning services.  
Choose between using eliteraretrader, elitedangeroustrader or cmdr.club services  
Fully interactive view, resizable/zoom with pinch, refreshable, back and forward navigation etc


* 'Important Note Jotter' - This is a quick and easy to use note saver.  
One never ending notepad for all your jotting needs   
notes are automaticaly reopenned on startup,  
any changes made to the note will then show that it has been edited and ask you if you want to save :)
Lightweight and easy on the eyes   


* 'Galnet News Feed' - This is a direct full Galnet news feed, bask in it :)  
Newly updated from the old RSS realms, the Galnet news feed is a great source of information for the galaxy  
Fully interactive view, resizable/zoom with pinch, refreshable, back and forward navigation etc
