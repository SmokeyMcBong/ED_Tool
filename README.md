Brief..
------------

>Elite:Dangerous Android Application with 'sendkey' client/server feature

>This was initially started as a little side project as I really wanted all the useful
features from certain tools in one easy to use app.
Since then it has continued to slowly grow and become more fleshed out ( and less buggy :) )

Up to 6 consecutive keystrokes can be used within a sequence for each of the 24 buttons.   
Each keystroke can have one modifier key assigned (hold shift+key/hold control+key/hold alt+key)    
One button for deploying landing gear, another button to request docking, another for.... well , anything you want :)
